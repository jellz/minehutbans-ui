## What is MinehutBans?

MinehutBans is a plugin that server owners should install on their server. It operates on a centralized blacklist and will stop any blacklisted player from joining the server. We created this because cheating is a problem on Minehut that all players and server owners experience. We want to fight it.

## How does the blacklist work?

To report players, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FUa9gp8). There will be channels explaining MinehutBans more in-depth. When you report a player, a 'List Helper' will review the report and determine:

- if the player is cheating; and
- if the report is valid.
  If both of those answer YES, the List Helper will blacklist the player, meaning the player cannot join any server with the MinehutBans plugin installed.

## As a server owner, what should I do?

You should install the MinehutBans plugin on your server. It's completely free, lightweight, and you'll be helping a good cause. The best way to stay up-to-date with important MinehutBans news is to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FUa9gp8).

## As a server player, what should I do?

You should join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FUa9gp8) so whenever you see anyone cheating on any Minehut player server, you can easily report them to our team.

This plugin is only effective if both players and server owners do their part.
